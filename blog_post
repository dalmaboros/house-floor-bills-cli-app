CLI Data Game Project Steps
------------------------------

1. 'bundle gem house_floor_bills'
  - tests? y 
  - MIT license? y 
  - code of conduct? y

2. create bin file 'house-floor-bills' for executables

3. write shebang line for ruby interpreter in bin file
  - #!/usr/bin/env ruby

4. grant executable permission
   - chmod +x house-floor-bills
  - (to be able to run executable without evoking ruby interpreter)

5. create remote repo (could have done this earlier, but it's ok at this point)
  - git remote add origin git@github.com:dalmaboros/house-floor-bills-cli-app.git
  - git push -u origin master

6. create CLI object to encapsulate CLI logic:
  a) define HouseFloorBills::CLI class in 'lib/cli.rb' and
    - define #call method
  b) add dependency to environment file (house_floor_bills.rb)
    - require_relative "./house_floor_bills/cli"

7. declare environment load dependencies
  - bin/house-floor-bills: require './lib/house_floor_bills'
  - lib/house_floor_bills will require all other files
    - lib/house_floor_bills: require_relative './house_floor_bills/cli'
      - delete HouseFloorBills module
  - pre-written by bundler: require 'house_floor_bills/version'
    - change to: require_relative "./house_floor_bills/version"

8. stub cli.rb behaviors

9. add spec file I forgot to add!

10. create the bill object:
  a) define HouseFloorBills::Bill class in 'bill.rb' and
  b) add dependency to environment file (house_floor_bills.rb)
    - require_relative "./house_floor_bills/bill"

11. hard-code fake bill data

12. write real CLI behaviors

13. scrape real bill data

At this point, the program was working, but it wasn't truly object-oriented.

14. create the scraper object:
  a) define HouseFloorBills::Scraper class in 'scraper.rb' and
  b) add dependency to environment file (house_floor_bills.rb)
    - require_relative "./house_floor_bills/scraper"

15. create the schedule object:
  a) define HouseFloorBills::Schedule class in 'schedule.rb' and
  b) add dependency to environment file (house_floor_bills.rb)
    - require_relative "./house_floor_bills/schedule"

16. Made HouseFloorBills::Scraper responsible for all scraping

17. Made HouseFloorBills::Schedule responsible for containing bills

18. Made HouseFloorBills::Bill responsible for containing bill data
